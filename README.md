## 📁 My JavaScript Snippets

This is a personal collection of small JavaScript snippets, logic problems, and everyday coding challenges.

### 🎯 Why I Created This Repo

While learning JavaScript, I realized that I often forget things like array methods, string manipulation, or object tricks.
So I decided to create this repo to:

- Practice core JavaScript concepts
- Keep track of problems I’ve solved
- Build a personal reference I can return to anytime

### 🧠 What's Inside

Each folder contains bite-sized JavaScript code samples grouped by topic:

Each snippet is:

- Self-contained in a `.js` file
- Well-commented for clarity
- Console-based (no HTML required unless stated)

### ✅ Examples

```js
// Check if a number is even
function isEven(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
}
```

```js
// Reverse a string
function reverseStr(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}
```

### 🚀 How I Use This Repo

- I update this repo weekly as I practice
- I don't follow a strict plan — I solve what I feel like or what confuses me
- I treat this like my JavaScript lab

### 💡 Note

This repo is **not a tutorial**. It's my learning archive.
Feel free to explore or even fork it to start your own.
